# Probe-Request-Capture-Tool
This PowerShell-based tool captures wireless network probe requests using TShark (the command-line version of Wireshark), processes the data in real time, and stores the results in a CSV file. The tool provides detailed insights into WLAN networks and associated MAC addresses, making it useful for network diagnostics and analysis.
